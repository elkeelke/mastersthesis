# Introduction

Including Biodiversity in Life Cycle Assessment – State of the Art, Gaps and Research Needs (Winter et al., 2017)

Global biodiversity implications of alternative electrification strategies (van Vliet et al., 2021)
consolidating large-scale solar and wind development, rather than "dilute" or patchy deployment, could significantly lessen the burden on global biodiversity
