# Disposition (2000 - 3000 words)

## Introduction to the topic

Biodiversity footprinting for the energy sector: A high-level assessment of the climate impact of the energy sector globally and in Switzerland using an LCA approach

## Research questions and hypotheses

## Research aims

## Literature study: current state of research

### Methodology

Including Biodiversity in Life Cycle Assessment – State of the Art, Gaps and Research Needs (Winter et al., 2017)

Global Biodiversity Score (GBS) - commercial?

### Energy

Global Biodiversity Implications of Alternative Electrification Strategies Under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (McManamay et al., 2021)

Biodiversity Footprint: Measured as species impacted per GWh

Biomass highest biodiversity impact. Despite its low contribution to the global energy mix, its low energy density requires vast land areas, often overlapping with biodiversity hotspots
Solar: cause intense land degradation, their high energy density means they require significantly less total area to meet electricity demands
Hydropower and Wind: These also exhibited high biodiversity footprints due to lower energy densities compared to fossil fuels and solar
Fossil Fuels: Generally had lower biodiversity footprints per GWh than many renewables, though their impacts on aquatic species remained notable

consolidating large-scale solar and wind development, rather than "dilute" or patchy deployment, could significantly lessen the burden on global biodiversity
